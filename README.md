# My Python Example Projects

Self-explanatory. Feel free to copy.

## Simple Calculator

Just a calculator. Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. Has a range of two numbers.

## Day of the Week based on Date and Year

This program prompts the user to enter a date in the format "MM/DD", then combines the user input with the current year to create a datetime object. It then uses the %A format code to obtain the day of the week for the given date and displays the result.

## Hangman

This Hangman game uses the curses module to draw the hangman and the word on the screen, and to handle user input. The game starts by loading a list of words from a file, selecting a random word, and initializing the state of the game. The game loop then waits for user input, updates the state of the game, and redraws the screen. When the game ends (either by winning or losing), a message is displayed, and the game waits for the user to press a key before exiting.
